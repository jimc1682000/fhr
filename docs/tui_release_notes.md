# Textual TUI Milestone Summary

This document summarizes the cumulative changes delivered across the new Textual-based interface milestones.

## Interface Implementation (M2)
- Built the `AttendanceAnalyzerApp` Textual client featuring a configurable form, live progress log, summarized findings panel, and issue preview table.
- Introduced asynchronous background execution that streams status updates from `AnalyzerService` while supporting cancellation and graceful error handling.
- Added a `python -m tui` launcher (with optional textual-web handoff) and exported helpers through `tui.__init__` to simplify integrations.

## Testing & Tooling (M3)
- Localized the TUI progress workflow and added a Ctrl+L language toggle that swaps zh/en messaging at runtime.
- Expanded unit test coverage for `AnalyzerService` validation, background progress orchestration, and Textual headless flows including submission, cancellation, language switching, and textual-web smoke checks.
- Documented linting/test expectations and broadened developer guidance for TUI contributions.

## Documentation (M4)
- Refreshed README, usage, and documentation index pages with installation steps, textual-web safety guidance, architectural notes, and the new interface screenshot.
- Updated contributor notes, agent guidelines, and migration pointers for teams moving from the legacy TUI branch.
- Captured tooling setup for screenshot/recording workflows and logged the finalized decision record linked from todos and planning docs.

## Dependencies & Packaging
- Pinned the required Textual packages in `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` to ensure reproducible builds across CLI, service, and TUI layers.
- Synced i18n helpers and shared service utilities so the Textual client reuses the same AnalyzerService core and translation scaffolding as other entry points.

This overview feeds into the pull request draft requested by the team and can be used as a changelog reference for reviewers.
